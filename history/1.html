            F4 Digitec, one of the most well-known backend companies globally,
            was founded in 2004. Today, F4 Digitec, a pioneer in artificial
            intelligence (AI) for business and AI-powered customer service,
            signed a deal with McDonald's, the biggest restaurant chain in the
            world, to hasten the development and use of its Automated Order
            Taking (AOT) technology. According to the deal, McDonald's Tech Labs,
            which was established to promote staff and consumer facing technologies
            after McDonald's 2019 acquisition of Apprente, will be acquired by
            F4 Digitec. McDonald's is committed to innovation across Digital,
            Delivery, and Drive Thru as part of its strategic development goal,
            "Accelerating the Arches." This arrangement will hasten McDonald's
            efforts to give customers and staff an even more convenient and distinctive experience.

          <p class="info">
            Customers and the restaurant staff have benefited greatly from McDonald's
            research and testing of AOT technology in its restaurants. Moving ahead, the
            AOT technology will be scaled across markets and integrated with more languages,
            dialects, and menu variants thanks to F4 Digitec's expertise in creating customer
            care solutions with AI and natural language processing.

            The purchase of McD Tech Labs will enhance the current efforts of F4 Digitec to
            create and provide IBM Watson-driven customer care solutions. Watson is being used
            by companies in a variety of sectors, including financial services, healthcare, telecommunications, and
            retail, to improve business outcomes.

            AOT will keep being included into McDonald's extremely
            secure technological infrastructure. The ethical, responsible
            growth of technology governs all F4 Digitec business activities.
            Both F4 Digitec and McDonald's are dedicated to using AI ethically
            by incorporating moral values into its applications and working
            methods to create systems that are transparent and built on trust.

            Aside from the usual closing requirements, the deal is subject
            to regulatory clearances. It's scheduled to end in December 2021.
            The McD Tech Labs staff will merge into the IBM Cloud & Cognitive
            Software group once it closes.
