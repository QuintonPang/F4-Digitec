    <h1>Let me help you reach your fitness goals.</h1>
    <p>Hi there! I'm <strong>Emma Marvel</strong>,a certified personal fitness trainer and owner of Marvel Virtual Fitness Studio.</p>

    <button type="button">Get in Touch</button>

  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>For more than 10 years, thousands of individuals around the globe have connected with me to help them reach their desired health and fitness goals. As a 100% virtual fitness studio, my online exercise classes and 1-on-1 personal training sessions are accessible, affordable, and—to be honest—more convenient than sliced bread (you can wear your pajamas to class!)</p>

   <h3>Experience</h3>
   <p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve always been what some would label a fitness junkie. I’ve competed in a variety of team sports, run a number of marathons, and even snagged a few medals in bodybuilding competitions. From a professional standpoint, I earned a master’s degree in movement science and sports management from the School of Kinesiology at the University of Michigan, I have published a handful of graduate research papers in the areas of sports performance, I’ve worked as an athletic trainer for a variety of professional sports teams including the Chicago Cubs (MLB), the New England Patriots (NFL), and the Chicago Cubs (MLB), the New England Patriots (NFL), and the Colorado Avalanche (NHL).</p>

<h3>About Marvel</h3>
<p>
    In 2010 I decided to set out on a new adventure—build my own virtual fitness studio from the virtual ground up—and I’m happy to report that Emma Marvel Virtual Fitness is alive and thriving.
</p>

<h3>About my work</h3>
<p>
    As a personal fitness trainer and instructor my goals are to lead, instruct, and motivate clients (like you!) to work toward a healthier tomorrow. I’m a firm believer that a sweaty workout has the ability to cleanse the body, enlighten the mind, and heighten the senses, and lead to an overall feeling of wellbeing.
</p>

<h3><strong> I look forward to meeting you and discussing your fitness goals!</strong></h3>

<h1>Are you ready for a full-body transformation?</h1>
